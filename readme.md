# JARVIS - AI Desktop Voice Assistant ü§ñ
---

## Overview

**JARVIS** is an AI-powered desktop voice assistant built in Python. It integrates speech recognition, text-to-speech, OpenAI GPT-3.5 for advanced command processing, and a modern PyQt5 GUI interface.

Users can interact via voice or GUI to perform tasks like:

* Playing music on YouTube or Spotify
* Searching Wikipedia
* Opening websites or desktop applications
* Sending emails
* Asking the current time

The assistant provides a conversational interface and displays the full conversation in the GUI.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* pip package manager
* Microphone for voice commands

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MansiMantri/AI-Voice-assistant.git
cd AI-Voice-assistant
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**

* Windows:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

* macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. **Install required packages**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Set up `.env` file**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your credentials:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
RECIPIENT_EMAIL=recipient_email@gmail.com
```

> **Do not push `.env` to GitHub.**

6. **Run the application**

```bash
python main.py
```

* JARVIS will greet you and start listening for commands.
* You can also use GUI buttons for quick actions.
